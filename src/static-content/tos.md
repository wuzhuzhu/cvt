Using our app to do anything other than access the links to this "Terms of Service" page or accessing any page of our website other than our home page and this "Terms" page constitutes your consent to these terms of use. If you do not consent, do not use our website.

Your use of our website to do anything beyond simply accessing/viewing it (that is, uploading, downloading, commenting, etc.), constitutes not merely your consent, but also your electronic signature, meaning that you are contractually bound by these terms.

## Content
You are solely responsible for the Content you post, publish, display or otherwise make available on our Website, and for any other action or omission that results from your use of the Services (including our Content or other user's Content), or the use by a person or an entity that you have authorized under your Account.

You represent and warrant that you have ownership, control, and responsibility for the Content you post or otherwise make available on our Website, or otherwise have the right to do so. Your Content must not be misleading or unlawful, and must not violate any of these Terms, applicable law and regulation, or infringe or misappropriate any rights of any person or entity. We may remove your Content at any time, at our sole discretion, if we have a concern about your Content.

You own the Content you create! We will not sell your Content, nor will we use it in any other way as permitted under these Terms. However, by posting your Content or otherwise making it available on our Website, you must be aware that:

- You hereby grant us a worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license to use, display, publish, reproduce, distribute, and make derivative works of such Content to provide Services and as otherwise permitted under these Terms and our Privacy Policy; and,
- Your Content will be viewed by others, and therefore:
  - If you decide to set your Content public, you grant each User a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, display, publish, reproduce, distribute, and make derivative works of your Content through our Services and functionalities;
  - If you decide to set your Content private, we will use reasonable and appropriate measures designed to keep your Content confidential, and protected from any unauthorized access or disclosure. However, we may access or share your private information pursuant to the terms.
- When Content contains notice of a reasonable and customary license, (such as an open source license) such Content is intended to remain under the terms of such license when further accessed, distributed, or used. Neither party is permitted to remove reference to any such license.

Any Content you download, access or use from us or another User, is at your own risk and subject to these Terms and/or the terms accompanying such Content.
